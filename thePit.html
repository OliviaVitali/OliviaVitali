    <h>The Pit of Hopeless Misery and Despair</h>
    <p>
        Dear Reader,
        <br><br>
        My motivation for writing this book ultimately comes to this: combating hopelessness, misery and despair.  Some other uses of this book are to understand how other people think, how to form frameworks, and how to persuade and change minds.  These things are necessary to understand to support the main goal: getting people out of the pit.
            The Pit is a place where ideology fueled by negativity descends.  It is a place deepened by personal trauma, paradoxically an escape from personal trauma and awful circumstances and the creation of trauma and awful circumstance.
            <br><br>
            The Pit is far far from reality. The Pit may not be a place of ignorance.  Learning about the imperfections of the world can easily drive a person into The Pit.  The Pit is ruled by hope for utopia and despair at the gap between reality and utopia.  The more perfect Utopia, the further from reality, and the more the pit lures people deeper.  “Come with me to a better place,” says The Pit.  We’re building a foundation for a better world.
            From the pit come the cries of the anguished for the world they want.  As The Pit deepens, it’s harder and harder to leave until there is an inevitable moment of withdrawal from the rest of society.  This leads to literal separation.  A person may join a like-minded group to isolate from larger society.  They are doomed to ideological purity testing, in-group fighting for status, in-group fighting over the details of praxis, in-group fighting over the details of ideology, escalating shows of loyalty, and other forms of torture used to control members.  If a person becomes too extreme for their chosen group or if they cannot form a group, they may self isolate.  Nothing and no one is good enough for them and they stay in the pit alone.
            The Pit is a place where the brightness of the sun, the brightness of utopia is so out of reach that the only solution is to dig down.  You dig a pit to limit your perspective in search of The Answer to your Hopeless Misery and Despair.  From the narrow, deep hole in the ground, trapped alone or with others, all a person can do is look up at the sun and burn their eyes out.
        <br><br>
            How does a person get into the pit?  How can they escape?  Why do people inside the pit not “Just leave”?  These will take a long time to explain and everyone’s story may be different.  It is worth noting, however, that the patterns of escalation, unrealized or unreliable action, rigid frameworks, and negative emotions morphing into hated are common features of the pit diggers.
            The pit is never jumped into.  The pit is descended into slowly.  As people begin to expect ‘utopia’, they withdraw first from uncomfortable truths then uncomfortable realities then all reality.  Could their love of others motivate them to specific goals?  Could they work together to demand positive change?  Fortunately and unfortunately, yes.  This is reality.  Anything is possible.
        <br><br>
            Utopia is a tricky concept.  Why? Because Utopia will not look the same to everyone.  Some people’s utopia is other people’s hell.  Utopia can guide us to improve the world, solve problems, and share in the spoils of hard work.  Utopia can also be organizing society to benefit The Few at the expense of The Other
        <br><br>
            It is my belief that people enter The Pit not because they want to be miserable but because of their hope for a world that fits their framework.   As frameworks intensify and begin to detach from pro-social behavior, the human-ness of humans shrinks.  And when the goalposts are out of reach.  When nothing is good enough.  When anti-social actions are justified, over justified, until pretenses are dropped and violence is finally praised...that is The Pit.
            Be careful, dear reader, what you believe in.  How certain are you of your ideology?  What are you willing to do to defend it?  How much hatred do you allow yourself?  How much humanity do you recognize in others?  If they are your enemy, what is their fate?  Can you stomach hatred in the minds of your closest friends and family?  What is utopia and who gets to live there? Are you trying to build a better world or are you trying to build YOUR world?

        Best Wishes,
